We changed from using straight if statments to a looping structure.  Before the game always had a predictable end, but now since the game loops, you can theoretically play forever.

To accomplish this we are thinking of the game as a datastructure of locations.  Each location has an adjacent location allowing travel.  Some locations have story content that are read out upon first visit.

It's hard to imagine an improved structure given our limited exposure to the problem, though I am certain that this structure can still stand to be improved upon.
